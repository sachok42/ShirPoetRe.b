## Description
A poetry writing environment that provides users with a range of options: highlighting stress in verbs, the ability to generate the beginning of a poem on demand (for inspiration, because getting started is often the hardest part).

## Use cases
* Highlighting stress in words is very useful for rhymes.
* The ability to generate the beginning of a poem on a given topic using tags to make it easier to start.
* A convenient environment for writing text with a "Focus" mode, i.e., disabling the entire interface so as not to distract you.
* Highlighting grammatical errors.
